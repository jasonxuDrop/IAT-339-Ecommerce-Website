            <p>The keycap profile refers to the overall shape of the keycap, some keycaps are flat, some are rounded, with many different shapes as well. There are certain styles in which each row of keys has a different height to allow for a concave or sloped shape over the entire keycap set.</p>
            <p class="col-1">By changing the shape of your keycaps, it lets you take the style and feel of your keyboard to a whole new level. There are several different profiles and shapes of keycaps to select from. There are many more profiles as well, they are just more uncommon are harder to get ahold.</p>
